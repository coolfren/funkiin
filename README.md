# Funkiin
# WARNING: I will be halting progress on this port due to the code being a mess and a poor library choice. Instead I will be developing FNF SDL2 which will support much more than just the Wii.
this is a port of friday night funkin to the wii
## building
you need MLlib and devkitppc installed, i'm going to assume you do have both installed
## i just want to stay as a consoomer
fine just go to the "Releases" tab to get the prebuilts
## modding
gameplay not done yet, will explain once you can hit notes
